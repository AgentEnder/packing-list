# Weather Integration

## Overview

Automatically suggest packing items based on weather forecasts for trip destinations. This feature will help users pack appropriate clothing and accessories based on expected weather conditions during their trip.

## User Benefit

- Pack weather-appropriate clothing
- Avoid overpacking for different weather conditions
- Get automatic suggestions for weather-specific items
- Receive alerts for extreme weather conditions

## Technical Implementation

### External API Integration

- OpenWeatherMap API for weather forecasts
- Google Places API for location geocoding
- Cache weather data in localStorage with 3-hour expiry

### Data Model Extensions

```typescript
interface Location {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  lat: number;
  lng: number;
}

interface WeatherForecast {
  date: string;
  location: Location;
  tempHigh: number;
  tempLow: number;
  precipitation: number;
  conditions: string[];
  humidity: number;
}

interface WeatherBasedRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  conditions: WeatherCondition[];
  items: WeatherItem[];
}

interface WeatherCondition {
  type: 'temp' | 'precipitation' | 'conditions';
  operator: '>' | '<' | '==' | 'includes';
  value: number | string;
}

interface WeatherItem {
  name: string;
  quantity: number;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### New Components

1. Weather Forecast Display

   - Daily weather cards in trip timeline
   - Temperature range visualization
   - Precipitation probability
   - Weather icons

2. Weather-based Item Suggestions

   - Automatic suggestions based on forecast
   - Weather condition rules editor
   - Override suggestions manually

3. Weather Alert Banner
   - Show alerts for extreme conditions
   - Suggest additional items
   - Link to weather details

### Implementation Steps

1. Set up API integrations and caching
2. Create weather data models and state management
3. Build weather display components
4. Implement weather-based suggestion system
5. Add weather alert system
6. Create weather rule editor

### Default Weather Rules

- Rain forecast > 50%: Add umbrella, rain jacket
- Temp < 40°F: Add winter coat, gloves, hat
- Temp > 85°F: Add sunscreen, hat, sunglasses
- Snow conditions: Add snow boots, winter accessories
- Beach conditions: Add beach gear, sunscreen

### Testing Strategy

- Mock weather API responses
- Test suggestion logic
- Test caching system
- E2E tests for weather integration flow

## Future Enhancements

- Historical weather data analysis
- Multiple weather data sources
- Custom weather rules
- Seasonal packing suggestions
- Weather-based packing optimization
- Real-time weather alerts during trip
